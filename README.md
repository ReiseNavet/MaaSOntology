# maas-onto

This ontology has been developed in the [ReiseNavet](https://reisenavet.no/) project. The ontology is focused on MaaS as seen from the perspective of the traveller. On this assumption, the ontology has a “trip-based” focus rather than a “journey-based” focus. The former specifies movement of a person, whereas the latter is used for specifying movement of a vehicle. The ontology is developed on the basis of a set of use case scenarios. The scenarios are split into a basic MaaS scenario and extended MaaS scenario. The basic MaaS scenarios describes the fundamental functions of MaaS mobility, while the extended MaaS scenarios describes how for example the use of open and linked data can enhance basic functionality and create innovative MaaS services.  

# transmodel-onto

This ontology, also developed in the [ReiseNavet](https://reisenavet.no/) project, is a shallow OWL ontology transformed from an UML model of Transmodel v6, including the new modes extension as described in CEN TS 17413:2019. The transformation process is inspired by the following sources describing how to get from UML to XMI and from XMI to OWL:
